<Update label="November 17" tags={["RELEASE CANDIDATE", "Features", "Improvements", "Compatibility"]}>

## 2.1.0 PLUGIN Release Candidate 1 for Java 1.13 - 1.21.10.
Compatible with Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, Purpur & Folia (EXPERIMENTAL)

## New Features

### **Modular Translation System**
A complete replacement of the old `Messages:` block in `config.yml`.

- New folders:
  - `/core/messages/origins/` -> default language files  
  - `/core/messages/custom/` -> user overrides  
- Automatic synchronization of missing keys.  
- Supports:
  - single messages  
  - lists (`lines:`)  
  - sections (`header:` + `lines:`)  
- Everything visible **inside Minecraft** is now translatable.

A legacy config warning will appear if the old `Messages:` section is still present.

### **Expansion System**
VCT now supports first-party and custom expansions using a clean API.

- New commands:
  - `/vct expansion info <id>`
  - `/vct expansion enable <id>`
  - `/vct expansion disable <id>`
  - `/vct expansion reload <id>`
  - `/vct expansion reloadall`
- Expansions include metadata, help sections, and isolated configuration.

The new official VCT expansions are in the works, so stay tuned for our announcements! 👀

## Improvements

- Major internal cleanup & refactor of the command system.  
- Rewrote help menus to use the new translation structure.  
- Unified message formatting across commands & expansions.  
- Improved auto-updater messages and reduced duplicated logs.  
- Improved structure of config loading for timers & core folders.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed missing translation keys not being created on first load.  
- Fixed issues with list-based translations showing incorrectly.  
- Fixed rare startup errors caused by load order.  
- Fixed multiple formatting inconsistencies across commands.
